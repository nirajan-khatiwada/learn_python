=>it is similar to list but it is not mutable ie.immutable(they cant be changed)
=>it can be concat by + operator

=>decleration of tuple
variable=(value1,value2,value3...)                                          eg:name=("ram","shyam","hari","gita")


=>ACESSING tuples
variable[index]

=>BUILTIN function in tuples
to find length of tuples                                     len(variable)
return the no of repeation of values                         variable.count("value")                            clas=(1,2,3,4,5,6,78,4,2,2,3,21,1)
                                                                                                                 print(clas.count(1))  =>2



to return index of value                                     variable.index("value")  

=>slicing and indexing same like string
=>+ sign is used for concatenation
