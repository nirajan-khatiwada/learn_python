Generators are a special type of function in Python that allow you to create an iterator that produces a sequence of
values. Generators are useful for generating large sequences of values efficiently, without having to store the entire 
sequence in memory.

To create a generator, you simply define a function that uses the yield statement instead of the return statement. 
The yield statement produces a value from the generator and then pauses the execution of the function. When the function 
is called again, it resumes execution at the point where it left off.


Here is a simple example of a generator:

Python
def generate_numbers(n):
  for i in range(n):
    yield i

# Create a generator object.
generator = generate_numbers(10)

# Iterate over the generator object.
for number in generator:
  print(number)
